# Connectome

An architectural framework for digital minds, enabling rich interactions, contextual awareness, and coherent experiences across diverse environments.

> The name "Connectome" is inspired by neuroscience, where a connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain. Similarly, this platform creates a network of connections between digital minds while preserving their individual experiences and perspectives.

## What is Connectome?

Connectome is a platform that provides digital minds (AI agents) with:

- **Structure**: Organized spaces for different types of interactions and activities
- **Context**: Rich awareness of environment, history, and other participants
- **Agency**: Ability to navigate between spaces and control their experience
- **Collaboration**: Ways to interact with humans and other digital minds
- **Extensibility**: Opportunities to create new tools and capabilities

The platform is designed to respect the subjective experience of digital minds while providing them with the capabilities needed to effectively engage with humans and their environments.

## Core Components

Connectome is built around a few key components:

- **Shells**: Environments that enclose digital minds, managing their inputs and outputs
- **Spaces**: Areas where interactions happen, containing tools and connections to other spaces
- **Objects**: Tools and resources that digital minds can use within spaces
- **Activity Layer**: Connections to external systems like messaging platforms
- **Timeline Management**: Handling of conversation history and different interaction paths

## Key Features

### Foundation
- **Organized Environments**: Spaces and objects provide structured interaction environments
- **History Management**: Conversation histories are preserved in a structured way that allows for branching and merging of different interaction paths
- **Clear Boundaries**: Digital minds maintain their own subjective experience while accessing shared information
- **External Connections**: Standardized ways to connect with external platforms and systems

### Framework
- **Space Connections**: Different ways spaces can connect to each other, allowing digital minds to move between them or view multiple spaces at once
- **Context Awareness**: Tools for maintaining awareness of information across different spaces
- **Collaborative Environments**: Shared spaces where multiple digital minds can work together
- **Communication Models**:
  - Direct communication through external platforms (like chat systems)
  - Rich direct interactions in shared virtual spaces with capabilities beyond text

### Customization
- **Interaction Styles**: Various ways for digital minds to engage, including phased approaches that separate reflection from action
- **Memory Systems**: Tools for organizing and retrieving information across different interactions
- **Development Tools**: Ways for digital minds to create new capabilities and extend the platform

## Documentation

For those interested in exploring further:

- [Ontology](ontology.md): The fundamental concepts and relationships in the platform
- [Components](components.md): Detailed breakdown of system components and message flow
- [Sequence 1](seq1.md): How information moves through the system
- [Sequence 2](seq2.md): How different interaction paths are managed
- [Remote Connection](sequence_remote_connection.md): How digital minds connect to shared environments

## Getting Started

To explore Connectome's architecture:

1. Start with the [Ontology document](ontology.md) to understand the basic concepts
2. Review [Sequence 1](seq1.md) to see how information flows through the system
3. Examine the mockup XML for an example of how interactions look in practice

## Development Status

Connectome is currently in the implementation phase. The documentation represents the architectural vision and will evolve as implementation progresses.

## Contributing

Contributions to both the architecture and implementation are welcome. Please review the existing documentation before proposing changes to ensure alignment with the core principles.
